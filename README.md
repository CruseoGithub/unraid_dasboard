# Unraid Server Dashboard

<- This is a work in progress ->

This React WebApp is a Dashboard for all important Server settings of my Unraid Server. It features thee different Sections which can be managed:
-> An overview of general Server information (Disk space etc.)
-> Status/configuration of docker containers that are important
-> All Virtual Machines that are installed on the server

It gets the server information from a rest api that runs in a docker container on the server.
For now I implemented a dashboard with all three categories which will lead to a detailed page. The communication between the api and the app is functional aswell but has not been used yet.

Down below you see a preview of the dashboard
